\
\

*a. Describe the two distributions.*
\
Ans:


\
\

*b. Explain why the means of these two distributions are similar but the standard deviations are not.*
\
Ans:


\
\

*c. What is the statistical principal that describes this phenomenon?*
\
Ans:


\
\
\
\
\
\

# Part II
\
\
*Consider the four datasets, each with two columns (x and y), provided below.*
\

```{r}

options(digits=2)
data1 <- data.frame(x=c(10,8,13,9,11,14,6,4,12,7,5),
y=c(8.04,6.95,7.58,8.81,8.33,9.96,7.24,4.26,10.84,4.82,5.68))
data2 <- data.frame(x=c(10,8,13,9,11,14,6,4,12,7,5),
y=c(9.14,8.14,8.74,8.77,9.26,8.1,6.13,3.1,9.13,7.26,4.74))
data3 <- data.frame(x=c(10,8,13,9,11,14,6,4,12,7,5),
y=c(7.46,6.77,12.74,7.11,7.81,8.84,6.08,5.39,8.15,6.42,5.73))
data4 <- data.frame(x=c(8,8,8,8,8,8,8,19,8,8,8),
y=c(6.58,5.76,7.71,8.84,8.47,7.04,5.25,12.5,5.56,7.91,6.89))

```

*For each column, calculate (to two decimal places):*
\

*a. The mean (for x and y separately).*
\
Ans:


\
\

*b. The median (for x and y separately).*
\
Ans:


\
\

*c. The standard deviation (for x and y separately).*
\
Ans:


\
\

\
\
\
*For each x and y pair, calculate (also to two decimal places):*
\
\
*d. The correlation.*
\
Ans:


\
\

*e. Linear regression equation.*
\
Ans:


\
\

*f. R-Squared.*
\
Ans:


\
\

*For each pair, is it appropriate to estimate a linear regression model? Why or why not? Be specific as to why for each pair and include appropriate plots!*
\
Ans:


\
\

*Explain why it is important to include appropriate visualizations when analyzing data. Include any visualization(s) you create.*
\
Ans:
