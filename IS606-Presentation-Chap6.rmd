In this session we will look at the following problem 

![6.47](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kishkp/CUNY-StatsAndProb/master/IS606-Pres-Chap6-ProblemStatement.PNG)


**Solution:** 

To check whether there is a statistically significant difference between the Grads and Non-Grads, we form the following hypotheses:

H~0~: There is no difference in support between the 2 groups.

H~A~: There is a difference in support between the 2 groups.


Lets first calculate the row totals and change the layout of the table.


| College Grad | Yes | No  | Total |
|--------------|-----|-----|-------|
|  Support     | 154 | 132 |  286  |
|  oppose      | 180 | 126 |  306  |
|  Do Not Know | 104 | 131 |  235  |
|    Total     | 438 | 389 |  827  |


Next we calculate the expected count for each cell. The expected count for each cell is calculated with the following formula:

Expected count ~row~ ~i,~ ~col~ ~j~ = $\frac{(row ~i~ total, col ~j~ total)} {(table total)}$

Using the above formula for each cell, we get the following expected counts table:


| College Grad | Yes   | No    |
|--------------|-------|-------|
|  Support     | 151.5 | 134.5 |
|  oppose      | 162.1 | 143.9 |
|  Do Not Know | 124.5 | 110.5 |


Next we calculate the following  formula for each cell:

$\frac{(Observed count~i,j~ - expected count~i,j~)^2} {(expected count~i,j)}$

Using the above formula, we get the following table:

| College Grad | Yes   | No    |
|--------------|-------|-------|
|  Support     |  0.04 |  0.05 |
|  oppose      |  1.98 |  2.23 |
|  Do Not Know |  3.36 |  3.79 |


The chi-square statistic is calculated by summing up all the values in the above table.

The degrees of freedom is calculated using the following formula:

df = (rows - 1) x (cols - 1)


Chi-Square statistic

Thus we have the following values:

$\chi^2 = 4.3$

and 

$df = 2$

The p-value for this is `r 1 - pchisq(4.3, df = 2)`

**Since this value is higher than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypotheses**

**It can be concluded that there is no difference in support between the 2 groups**
